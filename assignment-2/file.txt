The “fib” and “helloworld” are the executables of a Fibonacci number calculator and hello world
programs respectively (c-code) that would be made available in the directory where your simple-shell.c
will reside. The file “file.txt” is some file that you can create with repetitive lines to test “uniq” command.
Note that you might have to know the location of the ELF file for the Unix commands. The “which”
command is helpful that would show you that the commands are stored inside the directory /usr/bin
The concepts and system calls discussed in Lecture 06 and 07 is required for the implementation of
your SimpleShell.SimpleShell should also support history command that should only show the commands entered on
the SimpleShell command prompt (along with their command line arguments).
Terminating the SimpleShell should display additional details on the execution of each command, e.g.,
process pid, time at which the command was executed, total duration the command took for execution,
etc. You don’t need to display details of the commands executed in the past invocations of the
SimpleShell. Basically, display all the mentioned details only for the entries in the history.
